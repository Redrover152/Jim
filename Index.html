		Welcome to my workout plan!
		<br>
		<br>
		Explore this site to see what I usually do for workouts:
		<br>
		<br>
		My Leg days are usually how I start the week off, it usually puts me into a hard working attitude for the rest of the week.
		<br>
		<br>
		Push days are always a favorite for most people who work out, I'm in the same boat. My push days put more emphasis on tricep and shoulder exercises than most people's, as a Cheerleader those are more important than having strong chest muscles.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally Pull days are some of the most rewarding days especially when you do a bicep workout and start to feel a pump. These days usually land on a Friday for me because they set me into a good mood for the entire weekend.
		<br>
		<br>
		Even though I only lift weights 3 times a week, I'm only really taking 1 or 2 rest days a week, cheer practice takes up 3 days where I usually would have rest. These practices are practically a workout in their own right, we are constantly throwing people into the air and catching them then pressing them above our heads.
